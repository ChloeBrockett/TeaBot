Hi! This is the BroccoliBot that I made for the LGBT server that I moderate. It's intended purpose is to assist with moderation

Current Features: 
	-Removes inactive users from the server, both with and without roles, who have not been active in 1-30 days
	-Protects users with a role from being kicked 
	-Displays the numbner of members who would be pruned. 

When you install it you need to create 3 JSON files 
	-roles.json  -> {}
	-protected_roles.json -> {}
	-config.json -> {"prefix":"<your desired command prefix>","token": "<bot token from discord developer site>"}

I will give you my bot token if I know and trust you but under no circumstances must this be shared. 

To run the bot, navigate to the directory in command prompt and run "node index.js". You should see "Ready!" when the bot has launched 

If you have any feature requests then raise an issue.
