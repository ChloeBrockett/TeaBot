Hi! This is the BroccoliBot

Required packages: request

Install Instructions:
once you pull the code you're gunna need to make 3 json files 
config.json
roles.json
protected_roles.json

in the latter 2 just open them and type {} then save
in config you need to add 2 fields:

{
	"prefix": "!",
	"token": "<bot token goes here>"
}

if you want to self host the bot then you can create one on the discord developer site:
https://discord.com/developers/applications

if you know me and think I'd trust you then I'll give you mine
to run: navigate to the directory in command prompt and type "node index.js"
